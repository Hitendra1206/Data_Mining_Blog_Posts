pch <- rep(".", n)
pch[outliers] <- "+"
col <- rep("black", n)
col[outliers] <- "red"
pairs(stocks, pch=pch, col=col)

# We see that stock prices when they open, close are at their highest, and their lowest have heavy correlation between
# each other, with very few outliers present, indicated by a '+'.Dots in the biplot show normal distribution of stocks
# across both Princial Components.
